# Data Analysis and Model Training for Tips Dataset

This notebook focuses on analyzing a tips dataset, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation. Several regression models are implemented to predict target values, with additional steps for tuning and assessing model performance.

## Introduction

The purpose of this notebook is to develop a regression model to predict tips using various features. The analysis involves:

- Preprocessing data for better model performance.
- Conducting EDA to understand data relationships.
- Training multiple regression models.
- Evaluating model accuracy.

## Libraries and Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run this notebook:

- numpy, pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
- matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization.
- statsmodels for diagnostic statistics.

### Based on the analysis of feature importance and regression models:

1. **Feature Importance Across Models**: The feature "total_bill" consistently emerges as the most influential predictor of tip amount across all models:

   - In **Linear Regression**, **Ridge**, and **Lasso Regression**, "total_bill" shows a strong positive correlation with tip, with coefficients around 0.83.

   - **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest Regressors** also confirm the dominance of "total_bill," attributing 75–77% of prediction importance to it.

2. **Irrelevant or Minimal Features**: Certain features like "sex," "day," and "time" show minimal or negligible impact on tip amounts across models:

   - "Sex" consistently has close to zero influence, and **Lasso Regression** reduces its coefficient to zero, implying it’s not relevant.

   - **Time and Day** have low importance, indicating no significant temporal variance in tips across days or between Lunch and Dinner, except for a slight preference for tipping more during Dinner, potentially due to outliers.

3. **Moderately Important Features**: "Smoker" and "size" show some moderate influence:

   - In **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**, "smoker" and "size" contribute around 6-7% to prediction accuracy, suggesting these factors may have a small effect on tips.

4. **Residual Analysis**: The residuals plot reveals a somewhat random distribution, though there’s a slight concentration around certain predicted values. A few points lie further from the zero line, suggesting possible outliers that could impact model accuracy.

Overall, "total_bill" is the primary determinant of tip amount, while features like "sex," "day," and "time" have minimal impact. The trend of higher tips during Dinner appears but is not strong enough to drive a time-series trend.

## Insights For Management

1. Total Bill Amount is the most significant factor across all models, indicative of the fact that larger bulls strongly correlate with higher tips.

! Strategy ! - Upselling or promotion of higher value items

2. The size of the dining party has positive correlation with the tip amount.

! Strategy ! - Tailored sevices or group focused events and promotions

3. Time and Day show low importance and should not be given that much though - no temporal variance
